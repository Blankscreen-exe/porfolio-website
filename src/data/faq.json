After your change of mind is taken care of, I will resume working with the new plan of action. <br/><br/>ðŸ“Œ Please keep in mind that it might cost, you and me both, some delays and I might need to revert some things that I have already done. This can take some time, so it is always better to have a clear communication in the initial stages of work."
