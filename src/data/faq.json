        "question": "What is your workflow like?",
        "answer": "I like to keep it straightforward:<br/><ol><li>1- You come to me with your idea and I ask you some questions about it (requirement gathering)</li><li>2- Once I understand the depths & details of the task, I will give you a breakdown of the task as milestones along with time estimations.</li><li>3- We discuss if the breakdown(point 2) needs to be changed</li><li>4- Once all of that is settled, I begin my work and provide you timely reports until it is done.</li></ol><br/>ðŸ“Œ But all of this may not apply to small tasks. There is no point in making you wait for task as small as writing unit tests for a small project."

        "question": "How often will you communicate with me during the project?",

    },
    {
        "question": "What happens if I change my mind about a certain feature of the project?",
        "answer": "Nothing much happens, except that you and I will revisit the time and work estimations and finalize it in a single meeting (if possible). After your change of mind is taken care of, I will resume working. <br/><br/>ðŸ“Œ Please keep in mind that it might cost us some delays and I might need to revert some things that I have already done. This can take some time, so it is always better to have a clear communication in the initial stages of work."
